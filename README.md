# Wysa Intern mini-project

## Tech Stack

- React
- Next Js

## General Points
- For Random images I have used [Unsplash](https://unsplash.it/300/400)
- I have not used any database everything is stored in local storage of the browser but can be easily shifted to a database if needed.
- The code is broken into Components, all the components are in the src folder. 
- Have used `useContext` to maintain the theme of the app.
